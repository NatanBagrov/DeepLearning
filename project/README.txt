Idea:
We are using simple NN to check if picture is document or (fish)image
We are using VGG-like DNN which tells if two pictures has common edge
Then we are using greedy approach to build picture with the highest "likelihood"
(Some of submitted files are actually redundant)

Requirements:
We are using keras, numpy and libraries given in dependencies.txt (some of them are redundant)
To install them please run:
========================================================================================================================
pip install -r dependencies.txt
========================================================================================================================
To download weights please run:
========================================================================================================================
python weights_download.py
========================================================================================================================
